# 💰 Donate Crypto

## 📝 Description
**Donate Crypto** is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to facilitate **cryptocurrency donations** through campaigns created directly on the blockchain.  
The project combines a **smart contract built with Solidity** and a **Next.js web interface**, allowing any user to create campaigns, receive donations, and withdraw funds transparently.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Solidity** — smart contract development  
- **Next.js / React** — web interface and wallet integration  
- **MetaMask / Web3** — authentication and blockchain interaction  
- **Remix IDE** — contract compilation and deployment environment  

---

## 📈 Results
